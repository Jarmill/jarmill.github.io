I"~<p>I am visiting LAAS-CNRS in Toulouse, France under a (delayed) <a href="https://www.chateaubriand-fellowship.org/">Chateaubriand Fellowship</a> until July 2022, working with their Methods and Algorithms for Control team. I will be jointly supervised by Mario Sznaier and Didier Henrion during this time. This stay is a part of a long-standing Northeastern-LAAS collaboration.</p>
