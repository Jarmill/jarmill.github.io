I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://control.ee.ethz.ch/">Automatic Control Lab</a>, <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a>, in the research group of <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~rsmith/">Prof. Roy Smith</a>. My thesis topic involved peak estimation and safety analysis (e.g. speed of a car, height of an aircraft, distance to an obstacle) 
through the use of occupation measures. My other branch of research involves data-driven control, including the in which the system is contaminated with a combination of input, measurement, and process noise (such as flying a drone with faulty motors and sensors on a windy day).

I received a Bachelors (EE) and a Masters (EE/CE) degree from Northeastern University in 2018, and a PhD (EE) degree from Northeastern University in 2023 (advised by <a href="http://robustsystems.coe.neu.edu/">Mario Sznaier</a>). I have always been interested in applied mathematics, and was introduced to control theory and sparsity during my co-op at ASML (Veldhoven, NL) in 2016. I learned about convex optimization as part of Mario Sznaier's course <a href="/assets/pdf/syll_sparsity_2021.pdf">Big Data, Sparsity, and Control</a> in 2017, for which I later became a teaching assistant.
