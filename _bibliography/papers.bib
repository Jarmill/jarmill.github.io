  abstract={Synthetic biology constructs often rely upon the introduction of “circuit” genes into host cells, in order to express novel proteins and thus endow the host with a desired behavior. The expression of these new genes “consumes” existing resources in the cell, such as ATP, RNA polymerase, amino acids, and ribosomes. Ribosomal competition among strands of mRNA may be described by a system of nonlinear ODEs called the Ribosomal Flow Model (RFM). The competition for resources between host and circuit genes can be ameliorated by splitting the ribosome pool by use of orthogonal ribosomes, where the circuit genes are exclusively translated by mutated ribosomes. In this work, the RFM system is extended to include orthogonal ribosome competition. This Orthogonal Ribosomal Flow Model (ORFM) is proven to be stable through the use of Robust Lyapunov Functions. The optimization problem of maximizing the weighted protein translation rate by adjusting allocation of ribosomal species is formulated.},

abstract = {Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are standard convex problems that are frequently found in control and optimization applications. Interior-point methods can solve SDPs in polynomial time up to arbitrary accuracy, but scale poorly as the size of matrix variables and the number of constraints increases. To improve scalability, SDPs can be approximated with lower and upper bounds through the use of structured subsets (e.g., diagonally-dominant and scaled-diagonally dominant matrices). Meanwhile, any underlying sparsity or symmetry structure may be leveraged to form an equivalent SDP with smaller positive semidefinite constraints. In this paper, we present a notion of decomposed structured subsets to approximate an SDP with structured subsets after an equivalent conversion. The lower/upper bounds found by approximation after conversion become tighter than the bounds obtained by approximating the original SDP directly. We apply decomposed structured subsets to semidefinite and sum-of-squares optimization problems with examples of H∞ norm estimation and constrained polynomial optimization. An existing basis pursuit method is adapted into this framework to iteratively refine bounds.},

  abstract={Semidefinite programs (SDPs) often arise in relaxations of some NP-hard problems, and if the solution of the SDP obeys certain rank constraints, the relaxation will be tight. Decomposition methods based on chordal sparsity have already been applied to speed up the solution of sparse SDPs, but methods for dealing with rank constraints are underdeveloped. This paper leverages a minimum rank completion result to decompose the rank constraint on a single large matrix into multiple rank constraints on a set of smaller matrices. The re-weighted heuristic is used as a proxy for rank, and the specific form of the heuristic preserves the sparsity pattern between iterations. Implementations of rank-minimized SDPs through interior-point and first-order algorithms are discussed. The problem of subspace clustering is used to demonstrate the computational improvement of the proposed method.}

abstract={Inverse optimization (Inverse optimal control) is the task
of imputing a cost function such that given test points (trajectories) are (nearly) optimal with respect to the discovered cost. Prior methods in inverse optimization assume that the true cost is a convex combination of a set of convex basis functions and that this basis is consistent with the test points. However, the consistency assumption is not always justified, as in many applications the principles by which the data is generated are not well understood. This work proposes using the distance between a test point and the set of global optima generated by the convex combinations of the convex basis functions as a measurement for the expressive quality of the basis with respect to the test point. A large minimal distance invalidates the set of basis functions. The concept of a set of global optima is introduced and its properties are explored in unconstrained and constrained settings. Upper and lower bounds for the minimum distance in the convex quadratic setting are implemented by bi-level gradient descent and an enriched linear matrix inequality respectively. Extensions to this framework include max-representable basis functions, nonconvex basis functions (local minima), and applying polynomial optimization techniques. }

A super-stabilizing controller may be found by solving a feasibility problem involving a set of polynomial nonnegativity constraints in terms of the unknown plant parameters and noise terms. A sequence of sum-of-squares (SOS) programs in rising degree will yield a super-stabilizing controller if such a controller exists.

Certificates of state-feedback superstability or quadratic stability of all plants in a consistency set are provided by solving a feasibility program formed by polynomial nonnegativity constraints. Under mild compactness and data-collection assumptions, SOS tightenings in rising degree will converge to recover the true superstabilizing controller, with slight conservatism introduced for quadratic stabilizability. The performance of this SOS method is improved through the application of a theorem of alternatives while retaining tightness, in which the unknown noise variables are eliminated from the consistency set description. This SOS feasibility method is extended to provide worst-case-optimal robust controllers under H2 control costs. The consistency set description may be broadened to include cases where the data and process are affected by a combination of L-infinity bounded measurement, process, and input noise.

  abstract={Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are important computational tools in controls, optimization, and operations research. Standard interior-point methods scale poorly for solving large-scale SDPs. With certain compromise of solution quality, one method for scalability is to use the notion of structured subsets (e.g. diagonally-dominant (DD) and scaled-diagonally dominant (SDD) matrices), to derive inner/outer approximations for SDPs. For sparse SDPs, chordal decomposition techniques have been widely used to derive equivalent SDP reformations with smaller PSD constraints. In this paper, we investigate a notion of decomposed structured subsets by combining chordal decomposition with DD/SDD approximations. This notion takes advantage of any underlying sparsity via chordal decomposition, while embracing the scalability of DD/SDD approximations. We discuss the applications of decomposed structured subsets to semidefinite optimization. Basis pursuit for refining DD/SDD approximations are also incorporated into the decomposed structured subset framework, and numerical performance is improved as compared to standard DD/SDD approximations. These results are demonstrated on H∞ norm estimation problems for networked systems.},

 abstract={Kernel dimensionality reduction (KDR) algorithms find a low dimensional representation of the original data by optimizing kernel dependency measures that are capable of capturing nonlinear relationships. The standard strategy is to first map the data into a high dimensional feature space using kernels prior to a projection onto a low dimensional space. While KDR methods can be easily solved by keeping the most dominant eigenvectors of the kernel matrix, its features are no longer easy to interpret. Alternatively, Interpretable KDR (IKDR) is different in that it projects onto a subspace before the kernel feature mapping, therefore, the projection matrix can indicate how the original features linearly combine to form the new features. Unfortunately, the IKDR objective requires a non-convex manifold optimization that is difficult to solve and can no longer be solved by eigendecomposition. Recently, an efficient iterative spectral (eigendecomposition) method (ISM) has been proposed for this objective in the context of alternative clustering. However, ISM only provides theoretical guarantees for the Gaussian kernel. This greatly constrains ISM’s usage since any kernel method using ISM is now limited to a single kernel. This work extends the theoretical guarantees of ISM to an entire family of kernels, thereby empowering ISM to solve any kernel method of the same objective. In identifying this family, we prove that each kernel within the family has a surrogate Φ matrix and the optimal projection is formed by its most dominant eigenvectors. With this extension, we establish how a wide range of IKDR applications across different learning paradigms can be solved by ISM. To support reproducible results, the source code is made publicly available on [code].},

Our main result shows that if the source and target domain are related by a linear transformation (a common assumption in domain adaptation), the problem of designing a classifier that minimizes a miss-classification loss over the joint source and target domains reduces to a convex optimization subject to a single (non-convex) equality constraint. This second-order equality constraint can be recast as a rank-1 optimization problem, where the rank constraint can be efficiently handled through a reweighted nuclear norm surrogate. These results are illustrated with a practical application: fault detection in additive manufacturing (industrial 3D printing). The proposed method is able to exploit simulation data (source domain) to substantially outperform classifiers tuned using only data from a single domain.},

	  abstract={In this work, we denoise speech samples using predetermined structural knowledge of decomposable convex optimization problems. To this end, we exploit the grouping/clustering property observed with speech spectrograms to iteratively obtain a sparse clean speech signal using a mixed norm penalty term. We build upon the Overlapping Group Shrinkage (OGS) algorithm and introduce time-frequency weights to the cost function to rid the sparse clean signal of the residual noise. These time-frequency weighting extensions are also empirically shown to effectively handle impulsive noise types. The time-frequency weights may be targeted to suppress specific noise types at desired time slices to further improve the performance of the algorithm.}
