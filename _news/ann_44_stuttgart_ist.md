 I will be visiting the <a href="https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/">Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control (IST)</a> at the University of Stuttgart on <a href="https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/events/Talk-of-Dr.-Jared-F.-Miller/">February 16</a> and will present results about data-driven safety quantification and errors-in-variables control.
