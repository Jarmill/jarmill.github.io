The <a href="http://www.eeci-igsc.eu/">European Embedded Control Institute (EECI)</a> organized a series of <a href="http://www.eeci-igsc.eu/doc/users/975/bib/program/eeci2022programmevf.pdf">summer schools</a>. One of these courses was "Sparsity and Big Data in Control, Systems Identification and Machine Learning," which was taught by Prof. Mario Sznaier and was hosted in LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse between May 16-20. I acted as a teaching assistant for this course, and delivered lectures about Interior Point Methods, polynomial optimization, Frank Wolfe algorithms and variants, and SDP approximation algorithms (structured subsets).
