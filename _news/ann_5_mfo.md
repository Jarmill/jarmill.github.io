I was a participant in the workshop <a href="https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2215b/www_view">Conic Linear Optimization for Computer-Assisted Proofs</a>, which was  hosted at the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach (MFO) between April 10-16, 2022. I gave a talk 
<a href="/assets/pdf/Distance_MFO_Presentation.pdf">Bounding distances to unsafe sets</a> on April 14 <a href="https://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/mfo22/">(schedule)</a>. I also recieved travel support from MFO.
