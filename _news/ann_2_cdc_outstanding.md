I received an Outstanding Student Paper Award at the 60th Conference on Decision and Control for the paper “Peak Estimation for Uncertain and Switched Systems.” Thanks to my coauthors Didier Henrion, Mario Sznaier, and Milan Korda, and congratulations to all of the awardees <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/CDC_2021">(video)</a>.
